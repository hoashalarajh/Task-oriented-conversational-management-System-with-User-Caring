# Task-oriented-conversational-management-System-with-User-Caring
The "Task-oriented Conversational Management System with User Caring" project aims to create an advanced system that goes beyond traditional conversational management. This system incorporates a user-centric approach by actively observing the emotional state and engagement level of the user.
The task-oriented conversation management system can adeptly discern the user's emotional cues and engagement levels within a predetermined number of interactions. Based on this understanding, the system is designed to dynamically adjust its mode of interaction. This entails the system evaluating whether it is opportune to proceed with task completion or if it should instead offer support to ensure the user feels at ease and is encouraged to share more information.
